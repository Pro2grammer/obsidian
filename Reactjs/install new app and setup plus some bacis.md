"npx create-react-app ./"

in app.js we use jsx similar to html but attributes are different eg "class" is replaced by "className"

in {} what ever code you use in js is printed in dom and even run
"<p>
{3+5}
</p>"

prints 8 on dom

by ths we can directly run js in html

to start server use 
"npm start"
