- sync works in a sequence and and doesnt allow excution of other items ultil sequentinally they are executedthis may cause problem if more users are using application and if 1 user chages something everything will stop or app will be down until he changes

good for few tasks

-  while in async if a function\taskis serving to one user other funtions\task will also start executing (offloading) and the exucution will not be squential but everything gets executed and app wont go down.

good for huge tasks




use promises
